    <section>
      <h2 class="article-content__subtitle">Know Your Objective</h2>
      <p class="article-content__paragraph">
        Before implementing AI in your classroom, clarify your objective. What do you want to achieve? You may aim to:
      </p>
      <ul class="article-content__list">
        <li>Improve student engagement</li>
        <li>Provide personalized learning experiences</li>
        <li>Streamline administrative and lesson planning tasks</li>

      <h2 class="article-content__subtitle">Understand the Limitations of AI</h2>
      <p class="article-content__paragraph">
        AI is a powerful thought partner, but it has limitations:
      </p>
      <ul class="article-content__list">
        <li>AI is not inherently creative.</li>
        <li>It is only as accurate as the data it was trained on.</li>
        <li>It can produce confident but incorrect outputs (a phenomenon called “hallucination”).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="article-content__paragraph">
        Tools like ChatGPT and Bard are improving constantly, but a targeted and careful approach is essential.

    <section>
      <h2 class="article-content__subtitle">Consider the Ethical Implications</h2>
      <p class="article-content__paragraph">
        Ethical and effective AI integration requires proper training and support:
      </p>
      <ul class="article-content__list">
        <li>Teachers must understand how AI tools function.</li>
        <li>Students should be aware of data privacy concerns, as AI tools collect and learn from shared data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="article-content__paragraph">
        Ensuring ethical usage protects both educators and students while maximizing AI’s benefits in learning.
