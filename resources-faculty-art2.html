      <h1 class="article-content__title">What AI Can't Do Yet: Exploring the Limitations of AI in Education</h1>

      <p class="article-content__paragraph">
        As more educational institutions adopt AI, it’s crucial for teachers and school leaders to understand its 
        limitations. This awareness ensures that AI is used effectively to support — not replace — the human aspects 
        of education. While AI has transformed many aspects of teaching and learning, there are still important 
        boundaries to what it can achieve. Let’s explore some of the key things AI cannot yet do in education.

      <section>
        <h2 class="article-content__subtitle">1. AI Cannot Replace the Human Touch in Teaching</h2>
        <p class="article-content__paragraph">
          Teaching is not only about delivering knowledge — it’s about inspiring, motivating, and building 
          relationships with students. Educators adapt to individual needs, understand subtle emotional cues, 
          and foster meaningful connections. While AI can deliver personalized study materials or adaptive quizzes, 
          it cannot replicate the empathy, encouragement, and trust that teachers provide through real-world 
          interactions.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="article-content__subtitle">2. AI Models Are Only as Good as Their Data</h2>
        <p class="article-content__paragraph">
          AI systems learn from the data they are trained on, which means biased or incomplete data leads to 
          flawed outcomes. In education, this can have serious consequences. For example, if an AI tool is trained 
          on a narrow demographic, it may perform poorly when applied to diverse student populations. 
          Ensuring high-quality, representative data is essential for any AI-based educational tool to be reliable.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="article-content__subtitle">3. AI Can't Think Outside the Box</h2>
        <p class="article-content__paragraph">
          AI excels at following predefined rules and optimizing for specific outcomes — great for repetitive 
          or structured tasks like grading. However, creativity requires breaking patterns, exploring new ideas, 
          and approaching problems from unique perspectives. Education depends on fostering creativity in 
          students, and this remains an area where human teachers are irreplaceable.

      <section>
        <h2 class="article-content__subtitle">4. AI Can't Deliver Engaging Lectures</h2>
        <p class="article-content__paragraph">
          The way a teacher presents a lesson can spark curiosity and passion in students. AI can present 
          information, but it cannot replicate the enthusiasm, storytelling, and personal flair that make 
          lectures truly engaging. A teacher’s personality, humor, and real-life examples create a learning 
          experience that AI simply can’t match.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="article-content__subtitle">5. AI Can't Provide Real-Time, Nuanced Feedback</h2>
        <p class="article-content__paragraph">
          Feedback is central to the learning process, helping students improve and adjust their approach. 
          While AI can grade assignments or point out errors, it struggles with interpreting tone, mood, 
          and subtle emotional signals. Human teachers can adjust feedback on the spot, offering encouragement 
          or empathy when needed — something AI currently lacks.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="article-content__subtitle">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="article-content__paragraph">
          AI is an increasingly valuable tool in education, but it’s not a substitute for human educators. 
          Understanding where AI excels — and where it falls short — helps schools make better decisions 
          about its integration. By combining AI’s efficiency with the human touch, educators can create 
          the best possible learning environment for their students.
